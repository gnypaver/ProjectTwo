Version 1.1

Changes and Updates


TaskMainPage.vfp

  Change made a line 24: WAS tsk.subject, NOW tsk.id
  Reason: tsk.subject was not displaying correctly.

  Update added at line 29 to 32: Added four more columns to the table
  Reason: The tables on the Task Main page were looking very bare, it needed more information.


CreateTaskPageExtension.apxc

  Change made at line 25: WAS tsk = (Task)con.getRecord();, NOW // tsk = (Task)con.getRecord();
  Reason: Line didn't seem to do anything and was breaking the application.
  
  Update added at line 36 to 40: Added createTaskPage method, sends user to createTaskPage.
  Reason: This method was called in the TaskMainPage.vfp file but was not declared.
